1. PropTypes are used to check the data used in a js file. With massive amounts of data passing through each file the PropTypes allow for easier identification of where each line of data comes from.

2. The lifecycle event in react is made up of three sections. The first section is mounting a component which adds the data to a dom. The second, updating, allows for the user to change the props and/or state. The third, unmounting, removes the data from the dom.

3. An HOC is a component that works a lot like a higher order function, whereas the HOC allows other components to use logic that it created. 

4. The reactstrap library allows for us to style components in react using a downloaded dependency. The bootstrap library allows for users to use premade changes to elements and put the on their own DOM. Or you can code in a CSS file, like a normal person.
